# Trello-clone

This app is a demonstration of how to recreate a more simplified version of
a kanban board. A popular example of such an application is Trello.

In Trello, you can create tasks and organize them into lists. You can drag both cards and lists to reorder them. You can also add comments and attach files to your tasks.

In this application we will only recreate the core functionality: creating tasks, making lists, and dragging them around

Notable third party modules we will use for this application are:

- React-DnD for drag and drop
- Emotion for CSS-in-JS
